# Smart_Commands_Discord_Bot
 This is a small Discord bot project that integrates ChatGPT in order to "smartly" acquire commands from regular sentences.

# Discord Bot Setup
In the OAuth2 section of your bot config:
 - set the scope to bot
 - give the bot Administrator general permissions

# Note: YOU NEED TO ADD YOUR OWN .env FILE
It just needs the variables below for contents. Make sure that the .env file is in the same directory level as the other Python scripts.

OPENAI_API_KEY = "[INSERT OPENAI API KEY HERE]"

TOKEN = "[INSERT DISCORD BOT TOKEN HERE]"
